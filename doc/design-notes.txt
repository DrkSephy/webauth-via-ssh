High-level Description + Remarks
================================

To avoid forcing users to re-authenticate every request to restricted portions
of a site, a password is typically used to obtain a short-lived authentication
token (in a session cookie, perhaps) that proves the user's identity for
subsequent requests in a session.  We follow this same paradigm, but with
public key authentication in place of passwords for obtaining the tokens.

In a little more detail, the usual username / password page that would issue
such tokens is replaced by a small javascript program that interacts with the
localhost (via websockets) to obtain authentication tokens, which are
ultimately delivered by the system's native ssh.  See Figure 1 below.

You may be thinking, "hey, many programs make use of ssh for authentication
already (for example git and other versioning systems, rsync, scp, curl...),
so why all the fuss here?  Why isn't this trivial?"  The main difficulty is
that all the programs on that list are assumed to be *trusted agents* which do
your bidding.  The browser is a slightly different animal, as it is constantly
executing unaudited javascript code from the depths of the internet.  As such,
that javascript code runs in a sandbox, and cannot interact much with your
system -- in particular, it can't talk to ssh-agent.  To solve this problem,
we construct a local websocket server (see `authd` in Figure 1).

Client Security
---------------

The prospect of poking a hole in the browser's sandbox might raise some
eyebrows.  Indeed, this should be heavily scrutinized.  At present, `authd`
listens (on loopback) for connections, carefully inspects the data it is
given, and invokes ssh for you in a manner that (as we hope to argue) shall
cause you no harm, irrespective of the javascript code that is talking to it.
The current protocol is very simple (`authd.c` is only 500 lines of C), and
should be amenable to analysis.

Server Security
---------------

As the proposition calls for myriad users to be able to ssh to the server
hosting the web service, both security and efficiency are clear concerns on
the server side.  Regarding security, we run a separate instance of sshd,
which can be thoroughly locked down, and if desired, run inside of a chroot.
Regarding efficiency, we employ a hack developed for github to efficiently
multiplex many users of the web service through a single account on the host.

The interaction is as follows:

1.  Browser requests content from a "restricted" part of the site, for which
	he/she must be authenticated.
2.  fcgi/httpd deliver a page containing some javascript, and a username /
	port combination for a special-purpose sshd they have running.  *NOTE:*
	they do **not** supply the hostname!  See step (4).
3.  The js code attempts to connect to a websocket, *running on the
	localhost*, and sends the username / port over the wire.  Denote this
	username by "ssh_user".
4.  The local websocket server (named authd above) reads ssh_user / port, and
	obtains the hostame from the *ORIGIN header* sent in the websocket
	protocol.  As related by http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-10.2,
	the origin header is used to

		...ensure that trusted browsers under the control of potentially
		malicious JavaScript cannot fake a WebSocket handshake.

	This prevents a malicious site from attempting to trick authd into
	authenticating to some other website.
5.  authd (carefully) invokes the user's ssh program, connecting to
	"ssh_user@origin" on the given port.
6.  The specially configured sshd on the server takes the supplied public key
	and attempts to locate the corresponding user in a database.  Should this
	fail, sshd will reject the connection (invalid user).  Else, normal ssh
	authentication continues.  If successful, sshd will run tokend with the
	username retrieved from the database as a parameter.  Denote this username
	by "web_user".
7.  Based on a secret key (call it K_token), tokend outputs an authentication
	token for web_user.
8.  The token from (7) is returned to authd via ssh, and relayed back to the
	javascript running in the browser via the websocket.
9.  The javascript code forms an authentication cookie based on the token, and
	redirects the browser back to the initially requested page from (1).
10. The fcgi server reads the authentication token from the cookie string,
	checks the validity using tokend, and serves the restricted content if
	that succeeds.


Security Argument
=================

TODO...


Remarks
=======

The current prototype makes a number of simplifications, and as such is
**not** secure in its current state!  It leaves out elements which are both
(a) relatively simple to implement, and (b) negatively impact ease of testing
/ experimentation.  For example, the restricted part of the web service should
be served over TLS, but this is not done, since most users running the code
locally do not have valid certificates.


Other approaches
================

Another approach we have considered in the past, was to use client-side
certificates to achieve cryptographically strong, password-less
authentication.  Client certificates are built right into the TLS protocol, so
it all seemed very promising.  However in practice, a number of issues detract
from this approach:

1. Most clients do not have certificates, and if they do, they are very seldom
   signed by a trusted authority.
2. Configuring web servers to request certificates is somewhat tricky, and not
   always possible; configuring them to accept self-signed certificates is
   much worse, and may negatively impact security in other parts of the
   system.

Public key infrastructure just isn't the right model for this application.
Much better suited, is the "web of trust" concept used by SSH.
